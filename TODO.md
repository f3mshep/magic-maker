Things that are left to do:

-Make select lists have arrows so user knows they are select lists
-Style search results page more
-Style individual card results more
-Write method that replaces color with mana symbol
-Add more content to home page
-Fix that weird issue with data lists. Might have to sink into some javascript.
-Add flash messages
-Make sure controller is routing everything properly
-Make sure that all pages that should have nav bar have most up to date version
-Add page that shows all decks a user has made and all comments
-Add formatting to cards in search results (hover image, border, margin)
